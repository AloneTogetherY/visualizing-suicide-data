# Visualizing suicide data


This project was created during a master's course in data visualization <br />
The suicide dataset used can be download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) <br />
The REST-API and backend were built with Java Spring. <br />
The frontend uses a materialize-design template as well as a few visualization libraries such as: D3, GoogleCharts, ECharts and Plotly.
