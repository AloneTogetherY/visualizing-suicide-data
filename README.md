# visualizing-suicide-data


##### This project was created during a master's course in data visualization at the University of Reutlingen.

##### A suicide dataset was used from https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

##### The REST-API and backend were built with Java Spring.

##### The frontend uses a materialize-design template as well as a few visualization libraries such as: D3, GoogleCharts, ECharts and Plotly.

##### To run the application:

> Simply navigate to data/build/libs \
> Run java -jar data-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
> Open localhost:1212 in browser
